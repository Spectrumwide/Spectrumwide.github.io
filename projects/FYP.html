          This project was assigned as final year project during Bachelors.Goal
          was to come up with the system which could take chest X-ray image as
          input to the system which can classify whether the person is suffering
          from Covid-19 / Pneumonia based on infection. score.

          <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Since this disease being new that was not
          encountered before , it’s always good to have a second opinion on the
          diagnosis. So, we have ensured that the technology we implement is
          user-friendly and which can help the doctors to the maximum, thereby
          ensuring proper diagnosis and reduced time.

        <p class="project-text">
          The traditional methods of examining the reports physically is time
          consuming and chances of missing out smaller details are more. In the
          present world, Image Processing in the medical field has a significant
          impact in making the job of medics easy. To make this job easy it is
          expected to have an automated system for medical image analysis
          related to Covid-19.

          A grayscale X-ray image serves as the input. After creating 12 color
          spaces of the entire dataset a deep learning model is trained on each
          of these colorspaces. Various pretrained models are used to train on
          these colorspaces. The best model is identified based on certain
          metrics like accuracies and losses and can be used to diagnose the
          results for test images. Each model is to be trained for 30 epochs,
          with 100 steps.

          datasets on the backend. A report of the X-ray is produced in PDF

          Once the user uploads and an image, the model scans the image and
          records the observations in a pdf file. Then this pdf file is
          automatically downloaded into the user's downloads directory. This
          file will be named as “Patient Report_ (date and time of report
          generation).pdf”. This pdf is designed using the streamlit module
          explained in section 5.5.4 of this report. Using streamlit the
          structure of the report is predefined. This pdf can be divided into 3
          sections. First section has the image that user has given and followed
          by the confidence scores of disease. Second section has two sub
          sections. These two sub sections have four random patches of both left
          and right lung. To generate these patch, lung segmentation takes place
          in the background. This segmentation is designed using a lung
          segmentation model designed using PyTorch. Soon after the
          classification model gives the confidence sores, the segmentation of
          lung takes places. This lung segmentation is derived in terms of a
          mask and not actual image. This mask is then given to opencv contour
          function. The contour function creates a boundary on the masks. Later
          by analyzing the mask size, a point polygon test is conducted. This
          test analyses the position of the point and consider only the points
          inside the lung segment. These points are defined as patches. Each
          patch has the size, 35px x 35px. For each patch, the haziness is
          calculated. In the same manner the haziness is calculated for both the
          lung and for all positive patches. To give out the final opacity
          score, an average of opacity score of both lungs is calculated.
