          The Email Tone Analyser is an innovative application portal that
          leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the
          tone of email communications. Built using React for the frontend and
          Node.js for the backend, this application provides users with insights
          into the emotional content of their emails, helping them to better
          understand and manage their communication style. The portal offers a
          user-friendly interface where users can input their email text and
          receive real-time analysis of the tone, sentiment, and emotional cues
          present in the content. By utilizing advanced NLP algorithms, the
          Email Tone Analyser can identify various tones such as positive,
          negative, neutral, formal, informal, and more. This analysis can be
          particularly useful for professionals, customer service
          representatives, and anyone looking to improve their email

          Motivation
        </h3>
        <br />

        <p class="project-text">
          The motivation behind developing the Email Tone Analyser stems from
          the growing importance of effective communication in both personal and
          professional settings. Emails are a primary mode of communication, and
          the tone of an email can significantly impact how the message is
          perceived by the recipient. Misinterpretations of tone can lead to
          misunderstandings, conflicts, and missed opportunities. By providing
          users with insights into the tone of their emails, the Email Tone
          Analyser aims to enhance communication effectiveness, foster better
          relationships, and promote a more empathetic approach to digital
          correspondence.
