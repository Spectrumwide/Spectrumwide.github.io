          The Email Tone Analyser is an innovative application portal that
          leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the
          tone of email communications. Built using React for the frontend and
          Node.js for the backend, this application provides users with insights
          into the emotional content of their emails, helping them to better
          understand and manage their communication style. The portal offers a
          user-friendly interface where users can input their email text and
          receive real-time analysis of the tone, sentiment, and emotional cues
          present in the content. By utilizing advanced NLP algorithms, the
          Email Tone Analyser can identify various tones such as positive,
          negative, neutral, formal, informal, and more. This analysis can be
          particularly useful for professionals, customer service
          representatives, and anyone looking to improve their email
          communication skills.

          Motivation
        </h3>
        <br />

        <p class="project-text">
          The motivation behind developing the Email Tone Analyser stems from
          the growing importance of effective communication in both personal and
          professional settings. Emails are a primary mode of communication, and
          the tone of an email can significantly impact how the message is
          perceived by the recipient. Misinterpretations of tone can lead to
          misunderstandings, conflicts, and missed opportunities. By providing
          users with insights into the tone of their emails, the Email Tone
          Analyser aims to enhance communication effectiveness, foster better
          relationships, and promote a more empathetic approach to digital
          correspondence.

          The Email Tone Analyser application portal is designed to provide a
          seamless user experience while delivering accurate and insightful tone
          analysis. The frontend, built using React, offers a clean and
          intuitive interface where users can easily input their email text. The
          application features a text area for users to paste or type their
          email content, along with a submit button to initiate the analysis
          process. Upon submission, the frontend communicates with the backend,
          developed using Node.js, which handles the NLP processing and tone
          analysis. The backend utilizes various NLP libraries and algorithms to
          analyze the email text, identifying key emotional cues and sentiment
          indicators. The results of the analysis are then sent back to the
          frontend, where they are displayed in an easy-to-understand format.
          Users can view detailed insights into the tone of their email,
          including visual representations such as graphs or charts to
          illustrate the emotional distribution within the text. The UI is
          divided into several sections, Home, input area, analysis results,
          about us and Documentation.
