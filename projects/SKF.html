          The Goal was to add a detailed touch to resume as it will be

          offer a deeper look and feel to the visitors.

        <br />

        <p class="project-text">
          In order to meet these requirements, creating this portfolio was
          driven by my desire to make a strong first impression and to provide
          interactive, engaging experience that reflects who i am as a
          professional. This website is not just a collection of projects but
          also a reflection of my passion, creativity, and vision for the
